# Introduction

**Dynamic Programming (DP): A Practical Introduction**

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique that systematically and efficiently explores all potential solutions to a problem by leveraging two key principles: *overlapping subproblems* and *optimal substructure*. When applied correctly, DP can transform complex problems into manageable tasks, often reducing computational time significantly compared to brute force methods.

---

### **Key Characteristics of DP Problems**

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**  
   A problem exhibits overlapping subproblems when its smaller components are solved multiple times during computation. Instead of recalculating these repeatedly, DP stores the results (via memoization or tabulation), enabling efficient reuse.

2. **Optimal Substructure**  
   A problem has optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems. This ensures that solving smaller components leads naturally to the best solution for the larger problem.

---

### **Understanding Through an Example: Fibonacci Sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic DP example. The sequence starts with $ F(0) = 0 $, $ F(1) = 1 $, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms:  
$$ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) $$

#### Problem Breakdown:
To compute $ F(n) $, you must find $ F(n-1) $ and $ F(n-2) $, which are smaller subproblems of the original task. These solutions are reused across different computations, making the subproblems *overlapping*. Furthermore, the solution to $ F(n) $ relies directly on the solutions to $ F(n-1) $ and $ F(n-2) $, demonstrating *optimal substructure*.

#### Efficiency Boost:
A naive, brute-force approach recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers repeatedly, leading to exponential time complexity $ O(2^n) $. Using DP, however, you store previously computed results, reducing the time complexity to linear $ O(n) $.

---

### **Comparison with Other Paradigms**

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Like DP, greedy algorithms rely on optimal substructure. However, they do not deal with overlapping subproblems. Greedy methods make a sequence of locally optimal decisions, which may or may not lead to a globally optimal solution.

- **Divide and Conquer**: Both DP and divide-and-conquer approaches break problems into subproblems. However, in divide-and-conquer, the subproblems do not overlap. Examples include merge sort or quick sort.

---

### **Why DP is Powerful**

Dynamic programming's power lies in its ability to:
- Simplify complex problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable subproblems.
- Avoid redundant computations by storing and reusing results.
- Provide substantial performance improvements compared to brute-force approaches.

For instance, consider:
- Brute-force Fibonacci: Exponential $ O(2^n) $
- DP Fibonacci: Linear $ O(n) $

This difference becomes increasingly pronounced as $ n $ grows, with DP dramatically reducing computational effort.

### **What's Next? Recognizing DP Problems**

Theoretical definitions of DP can be abstract, especially for beginners. Don’t worry—through practical examples, you’ll develop an intuition for spotting when a problem can be solved using DP. In the following sections, we’ll explore the two main methods for implementing DP:
1. **Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**  
   Solving the problem recursively while caching results for reuse.

2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)**  
   Building solutions iteratively using a table to track results.

### **The Two Main Approaches to Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic Programming can be implemented using **Memoization** (Top-Down) or **Tabulation** (Bottom-Up). Both methods optimize problem-solving by avoiding redundant calculations, but they differ in their approach.

---

#### **1. Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**

Memoization involves recursively solving subproblems and storing their results to avoid recalculation. It’s a lazy approach, computing only the subproblems that are required.

##### **Steps in Memoization**
1. Recursively break the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. Check if a subproblem has already been solved (stored in memory).
    - If yes, retrieve the stored result.
    - If no, solve it, store the result, and then return it.
3. Use stored results to build the solution to the larger problem.

##### **Example: Fibonacci Sequence Using Memoization**

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:  # Check cache
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:  # Base cases
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)  # Store result
    return memo[n]

# Example usage
print(fibonacci_memo(10))  # Output: 55
```

**Java Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FibonacciMemo {
    private static Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (memo.containsKey(n)) { // Check cache
            return memo.get(n);
        }
        if (n <= 1) { // Base cases
            return n;
        }
        int result = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Compute
        memo.put(n, result); // Store result
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Recursive approach.
- Time Complexity: $ O(n) $, as each subproblem is computed once.
- Space Complexity: $ O(n) $, due to the recursion stack and memo storage.

#### **2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)**

Tabulation solves the problem iteratively, starting with the smallest subproblems and building solutions step-by-step. It’s a proactive approach, solving all subproblems, even if some are unnecessary.

##### **Steps in Tabulation**
1. Create a table (e.g., an array) to store solutions to subproblems.
2. Solve base cases first and fill the table iteratively.
3. Use the final table entry as the solution to the original problem.

##### **Example: Fibonacci Sequence Using Tabulation**

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def fibonacci_tab(n):
    if n <= 1:  # Base cases
        return n
    table = [0] * (n + 1)  # Initialize table
    table[1] = 1  # Base case
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]  # Fill table iteratively
    return table[n]

# Example usage
print(fibonacci_tab(10))  # Output: 55
```

**Java Implementation:**
```java
public class FibonacciTab {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) { // Base cases
            return n;
        }
        int[] table = new int[n + 1]; // Initialize table
        table[0] = 0;
        table[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // Fill table iteratively
            table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2];
        }
        return table[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Iterative approach.
- Time Complexity: $ O(n) $, as each subproblem is solved once.
- Space Complexity: $ O(n) $, for the table. This can be optimized to $ O(1) $ for Fibonacci by storing only the last two results.

### **Choosing Between Memoization and Tabulation**

| Feature                     | Memoization (Top-Down)         | Tabulation (Bottom-Up)         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Methodology**             | Recursive                      | Iterative                      |
| **Memory Usage**            | Potentially higher (call stack + cache) | Lower (usually just a table)  |
| **Ease of Implementation**  | Often simpler for recursion problems | Requires explicit table setup |
| **Execution Flow**          | Solves only necessary subproblems | Solves all subproblems         |

### **Optimized Space for Fibonacci with Tabulation**

**Python Implementation (Space-Optimized Tabulation):**
```python
def fibonacci_space_optimized(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    prev1, prev2 = 1, 0
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        curr = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, curr
    return prev1

print(fibonacci_space_optimized(10))  # Output: 55
```

**Java Implementation (Space-Optimized Tabulation):**
```java
public class FibonacciSpaceOptimized {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) { // Base cases
            return n;
        }
        int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0; // Store only the last two values
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int curr = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        return prev1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
    }
}
```

**Key Insights**:
- Space Complexity: $ O(1) $, by storing only the last two Fibonacci numbers.
- Best for problems like Fibonacci where only a few intermediate results are required.
